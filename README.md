# Sudokuka
JS/jQuery sudoku solver that uses bitwise operators to work its way through probabilities

That first implementation doesn't integrate every possible probabilistic strategies,
nor does it allow for much backtracking.
Yet it can fully solve most of medium difficulty grids available at http://www.websudoku.com/?level=2
and some of their hard difficulty grids http://www.websudoku.com/?level=3

The devil might not care for the time being...
